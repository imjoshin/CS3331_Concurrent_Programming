The logic of your program


Why does your program work?


The meaning, initial value and the use of each variable. Explain why their initial values and uses are correct. Justify your claim.


Can we use asynchronous channels to solve this problem? If you say "yes", prove it with a convincing argument. If you say "no", show a counter-example.


If the last thread in the chain receives a number larger than the one this thread memorized, then the incoming number must be a prime number. Why is this true? Prove this fact with a convincing argument.


Do you really need a mutex to protect the global array Primes when a prime thread is saving its memorized prime number? If you say "yes", prove it with a convincing argument. If you say "no", show a counter-example.


You must terminate your program gracefully. More precisely, The last three output lines must be printed by Master
